          <p>Photography Portfolio</p>
          <p>Client: J. Franklin Willis</p>
          <p>Challenge: The client needed a simple, functional portfolio web site for displaying and selling his prints. He also needed a customized content management system for managing all of his photos and their metadata.</p>
          <p>Working alongside my brother, I created a layout designed to be flexible to the viewer&rsquo;s screen size, utilizing as much screen space as possible for showcasing photography.</p>
