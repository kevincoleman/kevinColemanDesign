          <p>A website for a local eco-salon</p>
          <p>Client: <a href="http://www.fourfeatheredsparrow.com">Four Feathered Sparrow</a></p>
          <p>Challenge: The owner of Four Feathered Sparrow needed a branded website with easy access to make changes on-the-go.</p>
          <p>I developed <a href="http://www.fourfeatheredsparrow.com">fourfeatheredsparrow.com</a> on a Wordpress installation to allow easy mobile and desktop access.</p>
