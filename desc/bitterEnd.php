          <p>A logo for a local bowling team</p>
          <p>Client: The Bitter End bowling team</p>
          <p>Challenge: The client needed an illustrated logo of a specific angle &amp; scene, which could be used in a variety of mediums (embroidery, print, web)</p>
          <p>Solution: I illustrated the requested logo, and paired it with a type face to complement.</p>
